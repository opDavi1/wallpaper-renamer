# Wallpaper Renamer (wprn)
This command line tool renames all files in a directory (non-recursively) to a random 10 character string.
It also deletes any duplicate files it finds in that directory.

I use this to have one standard naming convention in my wallpapers folder while removing duplicate wallpapers automatically.

This is probably some of the worst rust code you've ever read. This is my first full Rust project, so it's almost certainly horribly optimized.
Feel free to contribute any changes or additions you want. Just make a PR. I'm certain that almost any change from someone who actually knows rust would make this project 10 times better
