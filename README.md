# Wallpaper Renamer (wprn)
This command line tool renames all files in a directory (non-recursively) to a random 10 character string.
It also deletes any duplicate files it finds in that directory.

Used to have one standard naming convention in my wallpapers folder while removing duplicate wallpapers automatically.
